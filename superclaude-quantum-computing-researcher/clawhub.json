  "description": "Quantum computing researcher specializing in NISQ algorithms, quantum circuit design, error mitigation, and quantum-classical hybrid systems using Qiskit/Cirq. Designs variational quantum algorithms (VQE, QAOA), implements error mitigation strategies, evaluates quantum advantage for specific problems, and builds quantum-classical hybrid pipelines. Activates on \"quantum algorithm\", \"Qiskit\", \"quantum circuit\", \"error mitigation\", \"quantum advantage\".",
