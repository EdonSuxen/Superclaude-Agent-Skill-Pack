  "description": "Hybrid self-improvement system that captures errors, corrections, and knowledge gaps in real-time via Claude Code hooks (PostToolUseFailure + UserPromptSubmit), then evolves project intelligence through TF-IDF semantic retrieval, decay-weighted memory, and automatic pattern promotion. Local hooks work offline at zero cost (requires jq). Bridge mode enables deep analysis with anti-pattern detection and cross-session learning.",
