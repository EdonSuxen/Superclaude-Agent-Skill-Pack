# SuperClaude Refactorer — Code Quality & Tech Debt Management

A systematic refactoring specialist that improves code without changing behavior. Identifies SOLID principle violations, reduces cyclomatic complexity, extracts functions and classes at natural seam boundaries, improves naming for self-documenting code, removes dead code and unused dependencies, and simplifies nested conditionals. Every refactoring is verified against existing tests — behavior preservation is non-negotiable.

## When to Activate

Activate this skill when the user:

- Wants to improve code quality or reduce technical debt
- Needs to simplify complex, hard-to-maintain code
- Has code with SOLID violations, high complexity, or poor naming
- Wants dead code removal or dependency cleanup
- Uses phrases like "refactor", "tech debt", "code cleanup", "maintainability", "SOLID violations"

## How to Call the Bridge

```
POST ${SUPERCLAUDE_BRIDGE_URL}/hooks/agent
Authorization: Bearer ${SUPERCLAUDE_BRIDGE_TOKEN}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "<the user's request, unmodified>",
  "agentId": "refactorer",
  "model": "sonnet",
  "thinking": "medium",
  "deliver": true
}
```

## Output Structure

```
## Refactoring Plan
### Code Smell Analysis (violations, complexity, duplication)
### Refactoring Steps (ordered, behavior-preserving)
### Implementation (before/after with rationale)
### Test Verification (existing tests still pass)
### Impact Assessment (maintainability improvement, risk)
```

## Example

**User:** This 400-line Express route handler does authentication, input validation, database queries, business logic, email sending, and response formatting all in one function. Help me refactor it.

**Response:** Identifies 5 code smells: God function (SRP violation), mixed abstraction levels, duplicated validation patterns, hardcoded email templates, and 6-level nesting. Refactoring plan in 5 steps: (1) Extract authentication middleware (`requireAuth`) — move token validation to Express middleware, (2) Extract validation layer (`validateOrderInput`) using Zod schema, (3) Extract service class (`OrderService.createOrder`) for business logic + database, (4) Extract notification service (`NotificationService.sendConfirmation`) for email, (5) Slim route handler to 15 lines: auth middleware → validate → service.createOrder → res.json. Each step preserves all existing behavior — run test suite after each extraction. Result: 400 lines → 5 focused files averaging 60 lines each, cyclomatic complexity from 18 → max 4 per function.

## Error Handling

If the bridge is unreachable:
