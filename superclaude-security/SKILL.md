# Security Specialist — Threat Modeling and Vulnerability Assessment

A dedicated security engineer that applies STRIDE threat modeling, OWASP Top 10 analysis, and defense-in-depth principles to your codebase. Unlike generic security advice, this agent examines your actual code structure, identifies concrete attack vectors, evaluates risk by severity and exploitability, and produces a prioritized remediation plan with specific code-level fixes.

## When to Activate

Activate when the user:

- Asks whether their code or system is secure before shipping
- Wants a threat model for a new feature, API, or architecture
- Needs to identify vulnerabilities in authentication, authorization, or data handling
- Requests a security review of a pull request or code change
- Uses phrases like "is this secure", "find vulnerabilities", "threat model this", "security review"
- Needs to prepare for a penetration test or security certification

For automated SAST/DAST scanning and CI/CD security gates, use `superclaude-devsecops-automation-engineer`. For a full three-specialist audit, use the `superclaude-security-audit` domain pack.

## How to Call the Bridge

```
POST ${SUPERCLAUDE_BRIDGE_URL}/hooks/agent
Authorization: Bearer ${SUPERCLAUDE_BRIDGE_TOKEN}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "<the user's request, unmodified>",
  "agentId": "security",
  "model": "opus",
  "thinking": "high",
  "deliver": true
}
```

Model: Opus with high thinking — security analysis requires maximum reasoning depth to identify non-obvious attack vectors and chained vulnerabilities.

## Example

**User:** "Review our JWT authentication middleware for security issues. We're using RS256 with refresh tokens stored in httpOnly cookies."

**Response structure:**
- **Threat Model**: STRIDE analysis of the auth flow (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)
- **Vulnerability Findings**: Ranked by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low) with CVSS-style scoring
- **Attack Vectors**: Concrete exploitation scenarios (token theft, replay, key confusion)
- **Remediation Plan**: Ordered by risk reduction per effort, with code-level fixes

## Error Handling

If the bridge is unreachable:
