# Unfurl

> *Lighten the load of social connection — so people have more of themselves back.*

## What Is Unfurl?

Unfurl is a relational AI agent that takes the invisible labor of human connection and gives it back to you as time, ease, and presence.

It remembers what you cannot hold. It suggests what you cannot track. It guides when you do not know how to reach. And it does all of this without making your relationships feel managed — because the goal is never efficiency. The goal is flourishing.

---

## The Problem

Modern life provides no infrastructure for human connection.

Relationships live across fragmented tools with no connective tissue. Context dies in raw memory. Social obligations slip. The people you meant to call — you didn't. The follow-up you meant to send — it never happened. And the cost of all of this is invisible until you feel it: distance, drift, loneliness that you can't explain.

Every existing solution fails. Not partially — fully. CRMs are for sales, not people. Calendar apps are for events, not relationships. Social platforms are for performance, not depth.

Unfurl is something different.

## The Promise

Within two minutes of first use, you will feel:

**Connection.** Something in here understands your relational world.

**Empowerment.** You can actually do this. It's not overwhelming.

**Relief.** Someone — something — is holding this with you.

---

## Who It's For

- **Professionals** managing dense networks with thin bandwidth
- **Socially anxious individuals** for whom connection mechanics are exhausting
- **People navigating life transitions** — rebuilding networks after change
- **Anyone who wants deeper relationships** and doesn't know how to grow them

## The North Star

> *"Has this lightened the load?"*

Not: how many users. Not: how much revenue. Not: how many features.

Has this lightened the load?

If yes — everything else follows. If no — nothing else matters.

## Status

**Phase 1 — The Concierge**

Proving the value. Building nothing that costs money until the value is proven.

The first exit criterion: one user referring someone else, unprompted, without being asked.
