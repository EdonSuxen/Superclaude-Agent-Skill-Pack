## 1. Origin Story

This project did not emerge from a brainstorm or a market opportunity deck. It was lived.

The builder has carried this idea for years — long enough that it stopped feeling like an idea and started feeling like a debt owed to a past version of themselves. They know the pain of fragmented social tools, the tax of raw memory, the shame of dropped relationships, the invisible labor of maintaining human connection in a world that provides no infrastructure for it.

They are not building for a user they imagine. They are building for the person they were — and for everyone who carries that same quiet weight.

The urgency is real: no income, no job, all-in. This is not a side project. This is the move.

---

## 2. Vision

**Unfurl** is a relational AI agent that lightens the load of social connection — so people have more of themselves back.

> *"Has this lightened the load?"*

That question is the north star. Everything else is instrument.

The larger orbit: a solution designed for all of humankind that uplifts, stimulates living life to its fullest, gives people more control over their lives, more freedom, and more time for curiosity, growth, play, and adventure.

## 3. Core Users

| Segment | Who They Are | Primary Pain |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Professionals** | High output people with dense networks and thin bandwidth | Social obligations compete with work; relationship management is invisible labor |
| **Socially anxious** | People for whom the mechanics of connection are exhausting or intimidating | Initiation, follow-up, and reciprocity feel like performance — not presence |
| **Life-transition navigators** | People through divorce, relocation, loss, career change | Existing networks shift or fracture; rebuilding feels overwhelming without support |
| **Anyone wanting deeper connections** | People with surface relationships who want more — but don't know how to go deeper | No map, no memory, no momentum |

**Primary user lens**: The builder is user zero. Every design decision runs through: *"Would past-me have actually used this?"*

---

## 4. Problem Statement

Social connection is the most fundamentally human activity — and one of the least supported by modern infrastructure.

The specific failures the builder has validated:

1. Tools are **fragmented** — relationships live across contacts, messages, calendar, memory, and social platforms with no connective tissue
2. The labor is **human-only** — no agent, assistant, or automation takes any of the weight
3. Context dies on **raw memory** — who someone is, what they need, what you promised, what mattered — all held in one fallible human brain
4. Existing solutions **fail across all seven modes** the builder tested — no partial credit
5. The cost is **invisible** — people don't know how much this drains them until something helps

This is not a productivity problem. It is a human flourishing problem.

---

## 5. Solution Overview

**Unfurl** is a relational AI agent that:

- **Understands relationship context** and suggests personalized, timely social actions
- **Tracks relationships** across dimensions — not just names and dates but emotional context, history, momentum
- **Guides conversations** — what to say, when to reach out, how to follow up — without making it feel scripted
- **Manages social obligations and events** — birthdays, milestones, follow-throughs — so nothing slips
- **Grows smarter over time** — the longer you use it, the more it knows about your relational world

The core emotional contract with the user: **connection, empowerment, and relief — within the first two minutes.**

If a user doesn't feel that within two minutes of first use, the product has failed its first promise.

**Trust architecture**:
Referral → transparency → low-stakes entry → track record → polish

Trust is earned by sequence, not declared by feature list. The simplified first impression (per the builder's own probe) must not overwhelm. The five full promises come after trust exists.

## 6. Core Features

| Feature | Priority | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Relationship memory layer** | P0 | Persistent, private, structured model of each relationship — context, history, emotional tone |
| **Personalized action suggestions** | P0 | "It's been 3 weeks — here's a message for Jamie that feels like you" |
| **Smart reminders** | P1 | Context-aware, not calendar-spam — triggered by relationship signals, not just dates |
| **Conversation guides** | P1 | Not scripts — scaffolding. Prompts that feel personal because they're built from the real relationship |
| **Event/occasion management** | P1 | Birthdays, milestones, follow-ups. Nothing slips when the system holds it |
| **Emotional context tracking** | P2 | Passive observation + explicit input to understand relationship health and momentum |
| **Cross-platform presence** | P2 | Web, mobile, and API — full cross-platform from day one (no half-measures) |
| **Relationship mapping** | P2 | Visual or structural overview of who's close, who's drifting, what needs attention |

**Data architecture**: User-built profile + passive observation + behavioral patterns + life events. Hybrid rule-based + ML/AI. Knowledge graph underneath.

## 7. Success Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures | Why It Matters |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Unprompted return rate** | Did users come back without being nudged? | Voluntary return = genuine value felt |
| **Organic referral rate** | Did users tell someone else unprompted? | The strongest signal product-market fit exists |
| **Core action completion (no help)** | Did a specific % complete the core action unaided? | Validates UX clarity + true self-service |
| **Pattern of voluntary return** | Is return happening on user schedule, not reminder schedule? | Distinguishes habit from dependency |
| **Qualitative stories** | What words do users use to describe the change? | Emotional resonance is measurable through language |

**North star metric**: *Organic referral + unprompted return in combination.* If both are rising, Unfurl is working.

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Severity | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Capital depletion before traction** | CRITICAL | HIGH | Concierge MVP first — zero infrastructure cost. Bootstrap/self-fund. Slow organic growth. Free/beta users generate data before a dollar is spent on infrastructure. |
| **Infrastructure cost exceeds capital** | CRITICAL | HIGH | Data architecture decision is a 60-day gate. Do NOT build the data layer until the concierge phase proves demand. Code velocity is the constraint — address it directly. |
| **Real-world testing illusion** | HIGH | MEDIUM | The builder named this explicitly: real-world testing may fool them into thinking everything works when it doesn't. Build explicit break-detection into QA — assume it's broken until proven otherwise. |
| **Trust failure at first impression** | HIGH | MEDIUM | Simplified first impression is a non-negotiable design constraint. The 5-promises come after trust. Prototype onboarding with 5 real users before any investment in infrastructure. |
| **Privacy/data model failure** | HIGH | LOW | Privacy-first design is a founding premise and a non-negotiable. The data model is decided before any other technical decision. If the privacy architecture is wrong, nothing else can be right. |
| **Solo capacity bottleneck** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Solo is the plan. 60-day review includes: do I need a partner? The decision trigger must be concrete — not "I'm overwhelmed" but "specific capability gap X is blocking milestone Y." |
| **Over-engineering early** | MEDIUM | HIGH | The builder's own risk: every platform, every integration, every smart feature before anyone has used it. The concierge phase exists precisely to prevent this. |

## 9. Delivery Roadmap

### Phase 1 — The Concierge (Months 1–3)
*Prove the value. Build zero infrastructure.*

**Goal**: One specific user type, one core problem, one repeatable outcome.

- Manual mock: simulate the AI agent behavior by hand for 5–10 real users
- Identify the one action that produces connection + empowerment + relief within 2 minutes
- Measure: unprompted return + organic referral (both must appear before Phase 2)
- **60-day gate decisions**: data architecture, public vs quiet launch, solo vs partner
- **Capital discipline**: spend nothing on infrastructure until this phase produces a referral

**Exit criteria**: At least one user referred someone else, unprompted, without being asked.

---

### Phase 2 — The Data Layer (Months 4–9)
*Build the memory that makes the agent feel alive.*

**Goal**: The relationship memory layer is real, private, and working.

- Ship the knowledge graph / relationship model
- Build passive observation + behavioral pattern capture
- Validate privacy architecture (non-negotiable — this is done before anything else in Phase 2)
- Begin cross-platform presence (web + mobile)
- Monetization timing decision: does it start here or at Phase 3?

**Exit criteria**: A user who has used Unfurl for 60+ days says unprompted "it knows me."

---

### Phase 3 — The Full Agent (Months 10–18)
*Scale the core loop. Widen the opening.*

**Goal**: Unfurl works for all four user segments, not just user zero.

- Full feature suite live
- Platform facilitation model active (if pursued)
- Revenue model stable: subscription + usage-based + platform cut
- Organic referral loop is the primary growth engine — paid acquisition is a last resort
- Measure: qualitative stories, usage depth, emotional resonance signals

**North star check**: *Has this lightened the load?*

## 11. Analyst's Notes

*From The Crucible — written for the builder, not for a pitch deck.*

---

**What this project actually is:**

This is not a social app. This is not a CRM. This is not a reminder bot. Those categories all exist and they all failed you. Unfurl is something else: it is an agent that takes the invisible labor of human connection and makes it visible, manageable, and — most importantly — yours to feel rather than yours to execute.

That is a new category. New categories are hard to explain, hard to fund, and hard to build trust around. But they are the only things that matter once they exist.

---

**The tension that will define you:**

You hold two simultaneous convictions: *universal access* (everyone, every background, open to as many as possible) and *deep personal intimacy* (it knows me, it understands my specific relational world). These are not contradictions — but they are tensions. The path forward is: **start personal, go universal.** The concierge phase is the personal phase. Resist the pull toward universality until intimacy is proven. You cannot skip to universal by building for it in the abstract.

---

**What the capital constraint is really telling you:**

You are not constrained. You are calibrated. Unlimited capital would have let you build infrastructure before proving need — and the infrastructure would have become the product instead of the value. Your constraint is forcing the correct sequence: prove the human thing first, then build the machine. This is the right order.

---

**The real 90-day threat:**

It is not running out of money. It is building something technically impressive that no one uses because the first two minutes didn't produce connection + empowerment + relief. Protect those two minutes with everything you have.

---

**The north star is earned, not assumed:**

"Has this lightened the load?" is a question that must be asked of real users, about real relationships, in real moments. Design a ritual for asking it. Not a survey. A conversation. The answer will tell you more than any metric.

---

**On the name:**

*Unfurl.* Something tightly wound, finally opening. The self that was held back, now released. The connection that was coiled in anxiety, now extending. The builder chose this. It is the right word.
